Qubits together working as a composite system create bit arrays. These are a set of consecutive binary digits(bits) representing data in coded form, in which the significance of each qubit is determined by its position in the sequence and its relation to the other qubits. The difference to normal bit arrays is that qubit arrays also contain phase information and are subject to quantum interference.
