Z gate on a qubit:

To understand what the Z gate does, first you must fully understand the qubit. To achieve this, do the Basis Transforms module in Quantum Odyssey. The best way to think of a qubit is to <color=green>imagine 6 maximally distant from each other points on a sphere (a sphere is made out of infinite points)</color>. A pair of two perfectly opposite points on a sphere is what we call a measurement basis.

      

We have 3 pairs of 2 maximally opposite points on a sphere, hence 3 measurement basis: Z-basis, X-basis and Y-basis. The <color=green>Z gate does half of a full rotation of the sphere counter clockwise in the Z-basis</color>. The best way to understand how Z gate rotates the sphere is to actually see the rotations in all bases. Here is how the sphere is rotated by a Z gate in each basis, starting with Z-basis, then X-basis and lastly, Y-basis:
