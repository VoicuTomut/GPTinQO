The default quick keys for the user interface are:

"f" key: centers the screen

Control + Right Mouse Click: place an annotation on the circuit. Useful if you want to give tips for others to solve.

WASD keys: to move camera around, especially useful on large qubit sizes and long algorithms.

Mouse wheel up/down (hovering on Circuit Configuration): allows to quickly through a long Circuit Configuration panel

Mouse wheel up/down (hovering on Computation Map): zoom in and out

To place gates: Click and hold the mousewheel, the drop the gate on a slot in the Circuit Configuration

To delete gates: Simply through the gate somewhere outside an empty slot

To exit to main menu: press the Esc key

To (un)pause the ball at an important moment/ before an interesting event: press the Space key

To open/ close the Circuit Configuration: press the TAB key
