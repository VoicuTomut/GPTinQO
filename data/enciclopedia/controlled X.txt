To achieve the controlled X operation, also called CNOT, we need to place a CTRL gate on any of the qubits we want to define as master and X gate on the qubit we wish to control. The logic is: if the qubit with CTRL is 1 at that particular computational step (row in the Circuit Configuration), the other qubit will flip states. The Computation Map shows the behavior for all possible outcomes.

We can make CNOT work for when the CTRL qubit 0 by flipping it and then reversing the flip:
