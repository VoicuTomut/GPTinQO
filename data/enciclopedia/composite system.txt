In Quantum Odyssey, our symbols shown in the Circuit Configuration expand in the Computation Map as a composite system. A single symbol expands to two values: 0 and 1, while two symbols expand to four values: 00, 01, 10, 11 following the Least Significant Bit numbering convention. In the case of two or more symbols, we always see the circuits drawn in the Computation Map as a composite system: meaning the circuits shown are all the possible resulting combinations generated by visualising the states behind the symbols simultaneously, ordered by the Least Significant Bit method.
