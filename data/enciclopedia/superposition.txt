In Quantum Odyssey, we commonly use the H gate to create a superposition state. We visualise superposition as the moment of splitting a ball in two copies of smaller and various sizes and color. Remember that the size of the ball determines the amplitude of the qubit array.

/[i]superposition

Superposition is the main characteristic of the qubits and fundamental principle of quantum mechanics. Quantum objects appear to be at two places at the same time, electrical currents in a metallic wire can flow clockwise and counter-clockwise at the same time, or an object can sometimes behave as a wave and sometimes as a particle.

     

In quantum computing, we call that a qubit is in superposition when it is measured in the Z-basis, yet the quantum state is non zero in the X or Y-basis.

/[i]H all bases

If a qubit is in superposition already on the X-basis (such as in the 0 or 1 state in this basis, described by two blue balls or a blue and a red ball), the superposition on the qubit will collapse by adding another H gate, as shown in the two rightmost pictures above, through a process called <color=green>quantum interference</color>.

     

Superpositon and its relation to qubit phase:

To fully describe qubits and if they are in a superposition state, we need to describe their <color=green>relative phase</color> as well. This aspect is deeply discussed in the first chapter of Quantum Odyssey. If the phase is lost, a quantum system will end up behaving like a classical bit.

/[i]distort but z

Dephasing noise leaves the classical bit information completely intact, but as the name implies the phase is lost. In fact, <color=green> a classical bit can just be thought of as a quantum bit which dephases way too fast to take advantage of any interference.</color>

          

What is the difference between a probabilstic event and superposition?

In the picture bellow, we encoded a coin that can be heads(1) or tails(0). In the first half, we show a coin in tails(0) being tossed. The outcome of tossing the coin will be 50% heads(1) and 50% tails(0). If we were to flip the coin (by adding an Xgate, 2nd part of the picture) we would get the same result: heads 50% of the time(1) and tails 50% of the time(0). As you can see, the output is completely the same. Probabilistic events erase the data (lookup this entry in the encyclopedia).

Such probabilistic acts are in fact, not possible in quantum computation, pre-measurement! Quantum computing is reversible, meaning that no matter the state of a qubit and what changes it undergoes, we can always retrieve the initial state. Tossing a quantum coin, will have to preseve information. This is achieved through the quantum <color=green>phase</color>, as you can see bellow. The outputs will never be the same. As far as we know today, only measuring a quantum system is probabilistic, but all quantum processes are deterministic.
