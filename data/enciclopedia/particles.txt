Quantum physics underlies how atoms work, and so why chemistry and biology work as they do. You, me and the gatepost – at some level at least, we’re all dancing to the quantum tune. Particles make up matter and the forces with which they interact.  Quantum particles can behave like particles, located in a single place; or they can act like waves, distributed all over space or in several places at once. How they appear seems to depend on how we choose to measure them, and before we measure they seem to have no definite properties at all – leading us to a fundamental conundrum about the nature of basic reality.  Quantum particles also seem to be able to affect each other instantaneously no matter how far apart they are, but in a very special way where these effects cannot be used to carry information.
