        Examples
        example1:
        question:What is superposition and how does it revolutionize traditional computing paradigms in quantum computing?
        target: Superposition allows qubits to exist in multiple states simultaneously, enabling parallel processing and exponential computational speed-ups in quantum computing.
        answer: Superposition is like magic, making qubits do many things at once. It's complicated but somehow works for quantum computing.
        feedback: Your response lacks scientific clarity and accuracy. Aim for precision, explaining concepts with scientific rigor and without resorting to vague analogies.
        grade:3/10

        example2:
        question:What is superposition and how does it revolutionize traditional computing paradigms in quantum computing?
        target: Superposition allows qubits to exist in multiple states simultaneously, enabling parallel processing and exponential computational speed-ups in quantum computing.
        answer: Superposition enables qubits to exist in multiple states simultaneously, harnessing quantum parallelism for exponential computational enhancements in quantum computing.
        feedback: Your response effectively articulates the concept of superposition with scientific precision and clarity. Keep up the excellent use of language and technical accuracy.
        grade:8/10



        Also, don't be overly harsh. If the answer is correct, give it at least a 7. If it's incorrect, give a score lower than 5. Provide higher scores for answers that use technical and appropriate language.
